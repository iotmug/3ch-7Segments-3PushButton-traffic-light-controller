Key Features:
•    Minimum output load: 5W, maximum 500W per channel.
•    Independent output channels suitable for LEDs or incandescent lamps.
•    Flexible usage as a  3-channels, 2-channels, or 1-channel controller, depending on your application.
•    Not suitable for fluorescent bulbs.
•    Unleash your creativity! This board allows control of almost all AC voltage-operated devices, programmable via a computer. Basic programming skills are required.
•    The controller features a built-in LED to demonstrate how the lights will behave.
Product Description: User familiarity with basic programming language is essential for optimal use. 3CH Traffic Light Controller, Arduino-Based: Our programmable Traffic Light Controller is the ultimate solution for your traffic signal requirements. It accepts standard 110VAC and 240VAC line voltage, delivering 500 Watts per channel. It's compatible with full-sized LED and incandescent traffic lights, including household incandescent and LED bulbs. The board incorporates the latest solid-state relays technology, ensuring quiet and efficient switching for years to come.
Easy Programming: Programming traffic light timings is now a breeze with Arduino software. The USB-UART bridge is based on the popular CH340G chip, and the board comes pre-programmed with a simple traffic light demo code. Additional demo codes are also provided for your convenience.
Easy connect external device such as Bluetooth or wifi module via RX – TX pins: device has uart RX – TX pins specially for connecting external device. This is transmitter-receiver for data sending and receiving.
Getting Started: To start working with this board, follow these steps:
1.    Download and install the CH340G USB driver. Usually it’s installed atomically. 
2.    Download and install Arduino programming software from the Arduino website.
3.    Connect the device to your computer via a USB cable.
4.    Upload demo or user-written sketches to the board.
